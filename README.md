# vscode-keybindings

Keybindings for navigating VSCode without changing your hands' keyboard position.  Conserve calories while coding, slowing universe's increase in entropy.

Works well with Jupyter notebooks in VSCode.

<br>

## Installation

<br>

Open `File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`.  In the top right, above the searchbar, click the button with the `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` tooltip.

<br>

Backup your current JSON configuration if you have any custom keybindings defined.  Replace the file with the JSON file provided in this repository or add any sections you like.

## Keybindings

#### Cursor movement

Use `ctrl+(i|j|k|l)` like you would `WSAD` in a video game.  Use `ctrl+(h|;)` for word jumps.  Use `ctrl+alt+(h|j|l|;)` for `home` and `end` actions.  Hold `shift` to select over the navigation.

<br>

#### Tab Cycling

Use `ctrl+(,|.)` to cycle tabs.

<br>

#### Scrolling

Use `ctrl+(u|o)` to scroll up and down.

<br>

#### Notebook Outputs

Use `o` to toggle a notebook cell output.
